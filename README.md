**Group Name:** Version 0.1
**Module:** Software Engineering
**University:** University of Roehampton
**Sprint:** Sprint 1 - Setup & Planning

## Project Overview

The **Community Skill & Item Sharing Platform** is a web-based application designed to help local community members share **skills** and **items** through mutual, non-financial exchange.

The project responds to the current **cost-of-living crisis** by reducing unnecessary spending and waste, while encouraging trust-based community interaction.

This repository contains the **initial project setup**, planning artefacts, and environment configuration required for **Sprint 1**.

## Problem Statement

Many people struggle to afford items they need only occasionally or services they cannot easily pay for. At the same time, many individuals possess underutilised skills and items that remain unused.

Existing solutions are often:

* Expensive
* Environmentally wasteful
* Exclusionary to low-income users
* Transaction-focused rather than community-focused

---

## Our Solution

We propose a platform that enables users to:

* Exchange skills (e.g. tutoring, repairs, cooking)
* Share items (e.g. tools, books, equipment)
* Build trust through ratings and reputation
* Support one another through mutual, non-financial exchange

---

## How the Platform Works

1. **Sign Up** – Users create a profile with basic information and location
2. **List** – Users offer skills or items they are willing to share
3. **Browse** – Users search for skills or items nearby
4. **Request** – Users request help or items from others
5. **Exchange** – Users meet to exchange items or services
6. **Rate** – Users leave ratings to build trust and accountability
